* we have classified the conversations of the incredible dune community to help get started for any newcomers
* this repository can serve to record pearls of wisdom shared among the community for easy access
* most importantly, we at The Rational AI [TRAI]  have learned to use dune by standing on the shoulders of dune expert discussions.

The repository will be continuously updated and organized for dune enthusiasts to search already asked queries and save time. 
Hope this repository will serve as a StackOverflow and encourage insightful discussions around the questions asked in the discord channel.
